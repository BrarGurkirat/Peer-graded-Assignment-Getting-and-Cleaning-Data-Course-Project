## Variables

- `subject`: Identifier for the subject who performed the activity.
- `activity`: Descriptive name of the activity (e.g., WALKING, SITTING).
- `mean()`: Average of the measurements for each feature.
- `std()`: Standard deviation of the measurements for each feature.

## Data Transformation Steps

1. Merged training and test sets.
2. Extracted measurements on mean and standard deviation.
3. Named activities using descriptive names.
4. Labeled dataset with descriptive variable names.
5. Created a tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and subject.
